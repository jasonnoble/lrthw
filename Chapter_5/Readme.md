biggest problem in ex5 extra credit (ec2) is that I couldn't make the floating
point problem go away. I used centimeters to inches and used the conventional
2.54 cm to inch. But when I ran the program it wouldn't print the final multiplication
to the .54 decimal

I googled but couldn't find any resolution to the issue.
