Q) What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

then answer each in my own words.

1) Reading and writing. 
It's essential because like any foreign language you have 
to practice _because_ it doesn't make sense. suddenly
it will click. Writing helps accelerate that familiarity
since you'll be typing foreign characters and absorbing
their syntax

2) Spotting Differences
In something technical like code, a simple space or character
could be the difference between success and failure
Learning what to spot, how to spot and why to spot
will help create an understanding of the relationships
and behaviors (bugs or unexpected behavior) that
happen between differences

3) Attention to Detail
Code is made up of very tiny details with a lot of 
implications if the details aren't specifically followed
Thus, training your brain to pay attention to and follow 
those details will help as we move from simple to more
complex code

Why do you need to not copy and paste?
a big part of the training of this book is repetitive
behavior as part of the learning process. Copy/paste
robs us of many of the building block fundamentals
that will help later learning. Plus it is more time
spent coding (even repeating something) so to learn
we need to go over and over as part of the process.
