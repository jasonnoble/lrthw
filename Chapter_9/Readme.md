I was able to get here are the days... and the days to print on the same line
but it also printed the next line "here are the months" on the same line
I added a puts command between them but I don't know why I had to do that

is there an easier way or is that how to get the next line?


only RGuard offenses I got were " vs ' so I changed them.
